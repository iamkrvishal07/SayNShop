#  Voice Command Navigator for React

A lightweight voice command assistant for React web app using native browser APIs:  
**`SpeechRecognition`** (voice-to-text) and **`SpeechSynthesis`** (text-to-voice).



##  How It Works

### `SpeechRecognition` (Voice to Text)

- Listens to user **spoken voice** using the microphone.
- Converts what user say into **text** (called a *transcript*).
- App matches that transcript to perform specific actions (like navigate to `/cart` or show the search bar).

### `SpeechSynthesis` (Text to Voice)

- Converts **text into speech**, giving **audio feedback** like:
  - ‚ÄúOpening cart‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúSearch closed‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúTry again‚Äù

This creates a natural voice assistant experience inside web app.

##  Features

-  Voice-controlled navigation
-  Spoken feedback for every action
-  Smooth animation on mic activation
-  Toast notifications on unknown commands
- Sound effect (`open.mp3`) when starting voice recognition
